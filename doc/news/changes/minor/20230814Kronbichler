Improved: deal.II now has a flag DEAL_II_USE_VECTORIZATION_GATHER to control
the use of gather/scatter instructions on the x86 architecture. On a wide
range of Intel hardware with microcode mitigation for the Intel Gather Data
Speculation (GDS, aka Downfall) side channel vulnerability, in particular,
server processors of the Broadwell, Skylake, Cascade Lake, and Ice Lake
families released between 2015 and 2021, these instructions can be much slower
than scalar loads. While the default behavior of deal.II is to aggressively
enable these instructions in the intrinsics-class VectorizedArray, the new
variable can be used to disable their use if deemed to give better
performance.
