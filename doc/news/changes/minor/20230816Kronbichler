Improved: The classes MGSmootherRelaxation and mg::SmootherRelaxation can now
also handle matrices of types `MGLevelObject<std::unique_ptr<...>>` or
`MGLevelObject<std::shared_ptr<...>>` in their `initialize()` functions by the
use of Utilities::get_underlying_value(), rather than MGLevelObject of the
actual matrix type only.
