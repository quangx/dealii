Fixed: The SolutionTransfer class writes into output vectors, but does
not call compress() on them. This is of no consequence for deal.II
vectors for which this class is mostly used (in contrast to the
parallel::distributed::SolutionTransfer class), but leads to awkward
downstream failures with, for example, PETSc vectors. This is now
fixed.
