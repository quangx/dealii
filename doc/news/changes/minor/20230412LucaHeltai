New: Added a function DoFTools::map_boundary_to_bulk_dof_iterators() that 
generates a mapping of codimension-1 active DoFHandler cell iterators to
codimension-0 cells and face indices, to couple DoFHandler objects of different
co-dimensions, initialized on grids generated with
GridTools::extract_boundary_mesh()
