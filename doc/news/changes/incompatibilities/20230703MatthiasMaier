Changed: The CMake configuration does no longer export git revision strings
and dates in `deal.IIConfig.cmake`. This avoids unnecessary
reconfigurations of client projects (such as the testsuite). Instead the
git revision strings and dates are now recorded in
`deal.IIConfigGit.cmake` whose path is recorded in `${DEAL_II_GIT_CONFIG}`.
This is similar to how we store the git revision in the header
`deal.II/base/revision.h` instead of `deal.II/base/config.h` to avoid
unnecessary recompilations of the library and user programs. User project
who need the information in CMake must do an
`include(${DEAL_II_GIT_CONFIG})`.
