Changed: The integrate() function of FEPointEvaluation now multiplies the submitted
entities internally with a JxW value to represent a proper integration like in FEEvaluation.
The old behavior (where the entities are only multiplied with the test functions and summed up)
is available through the new function test_and_sum().
