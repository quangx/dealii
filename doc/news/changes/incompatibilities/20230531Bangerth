Changed: The SUNDIALS::KINSOL, SUNDIALS::ARKode, and SUNDIALS::IDA
interfaces used to use callbacks through which users provide
information to these solvers. If user code encountered errors, this
was indicated via integer return codes -- a zero return value
indicating success.

This is not in line with how C++ typically operates; in C++ errors are
typically indicated via exceptions. The interfaces to the libraries
above have been changed to now use exceptions instead, and this
convention has been documented in a glossary entry on
@ref GlossUserProvidedCallBack "user provided callback".
