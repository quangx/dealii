Deprecated: All vector classes had member functions called `import()`
to copy elements from a source into the current vector. Unfortunately,
`import` is a 
[keyword (of sorts) in C++20](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/keyword/import). 
While not strictly necessary because we do not use the name in a
context where it would be recognized as a keyword, it is useful to
avoid the name nonetheless, if only to avoid confusing readers and
IDEs. As a consequence, these functions have been renamed to
`import_elements()`. The old name remains for now, but is deprecated.
