Fixed: The function ParameterHandler::add_parameter() used to
call the internal action. Within that step, the action
converts the default value to a string and back afterwards.
This can lead to round-off errors so that the default
values might change in the case of floating-point numbers.
The action is not called any more during ParameterHandler::add_parameter(),
fixing the problem.
