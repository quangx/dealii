Changed: For Triangulations created with
MGTransferGlobalCoarseningTools::create_geometric_coarsening_sequence(),
the MeshSmoothing flag Triangulation::eliminate_unrefined_islands will
be removed. It caused unintentional refinement during coarsening which
led to problems in GlobalCoarseningFineDoFHandlerView. See also
