MatrixFree::reinit() would always set up the data structures for inner faces,
also in case only
MatrixFree::AdditionalData::mapping_updates_flags_boundary_faces was set. As
this can lead to considerably higher memory consumption, the inner faces are
now only set up when requested, increasing efficiency. When inner faces are
desired, make sure to set
MatrixFree::AdditionalData::mapping_updates_flags_inner_faces.
