New: The new function distributed_compute_intersection_locations() computes
intersections on parallel::distributed::Triangulations using CGAL. It
returns a new class DistributedComputeIntersectionLocationsInternal which
stores the found intersections and relevant information about communication.
The class contains a helper function
convert_to_distributed_compute_point_locations_internal() to produce
DistributedComputePointLocationsInternal without an additional
(possibly expensive) search of points and can therefore be used to
initialize RemotePointEvaluation.
