Removed: Some, but not all, of the vector classes were derived from a
base class VectorSpaceVector. This class had been intended to provide
an abstract interface (via `virtual` functions) to vector-vector
operations such as dot products or norms. But it turns out that that
is not practical in many cases: Functions still need to either have
access to individual elements of the vector, or they need to be able
to do matrix-vector products. As a consequence, it is rarely useful to
only have a reference to the base class VectorSpaceVector: One
actually needs a reference to the derived class. Because of this lack
of use, we have removed the VectorSpaceVector base class from the
library.
